These utilities include:

- [Battlefield](#battlefield)
- [Data generator for selftests](#data-generator-for-selftests)
- [Test position set for BattleField](#test-position-set-for-battlefield)
- [SoFGameSet updater](#sofgameset-updater)

This project is mostly written in Pascal, as it relies on core libraries of
[Chess 256](https://github.com/alex65536/Chess256). These libraries were taken from the source
code of Chess 256 and slightly modified.

## Dependencies

On Debian/Ubuntu, you need to install the following packages:

- `fpc (>= 3.0.0)`
- `lcl-units (>= 2.0)`
- `lcl-utils (>= 2.0)`
- `python3 (>= 3.7)`

## Utilities

### Battlefield

BattleField is a tool to run many micro engine matches. It allows two engines to play many games
either on fixed time per move or on fixed depth.

To build this utility, run

~~~~~
$ cd battlefield
$ lazbuild Battlefield.lpi
~~~~~

Alternatively, you can open and build the project `battlefield/Battlefield.lpi` in Lazarus IDE.

The resulting binary is located in `battlefield/bin/battlefield`. Run the binary without arguments
to get more information on how to use it.

### Data generator for selftests

This small tool generates the positions for
[self-tests][1]. To compile and run it, use

~~~~~
$ cd selftest_data_create
$ lazbuild SelftestDataCreate.lpi
$ cd bin
$ ./selftest_data_create >boards.fen
~~~~~

The resulting `boards.fen` will be the same as `boards.fen` which is used for self-tests in
SoFCheck repository.

### Test position set for BattleField

This is not a utility, but a set of positions on which the engine evaluation function is tested.
These positions can be used with BattleField.

### SoFGameSet updater

This is a small script located in `gameset_upgrade/gameset_upgrade.py`. It upgrades dataset format
generated by BattleField v0.9.11 (and earlier) to [canonical SoFGameSet][2], which can be used to
generate datasets for SoFCheck.

Note that starting from BattleField v0.9.12, this script is not needed to perform conversion, as
BattleField is able to generate canonical SoFGameSet itself.
